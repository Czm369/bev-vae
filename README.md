## Abstract
<details>
<summary><b>TL; DR</b> We introduce BEV-VAE, a variational autoencoder that unifies multi-view images into a BEV representation for scalable and generalizable autonomous driving scene synthesis. </summary>
Generative modeling has shown remarkable success in vision and language, inspiring research on synthesizing autonomous driving scenes. 
Existing multi-view synthesis approaches commonly operate in image latent spaces with cross-attention to enforce spatial consistency, but they are tightly bound to camera configurations, which limits dataset scalability and model generalization.
We propose BEV-VAE, a variational autoencoder that unifies multi-view images into a compact bird’s-eye-view (BEV) representation, enabling encoding from arbitrary camera layouts and decoding to any desired viewpoint. 
Through multi-view image reconstruction and novel view synthesis, we show that BEV-VAE effectively fuses multi-view information and accurately models spatial structure. 
This capability allows it to generalize across camera configurations and facilitates scalable training on diverse datasets.
Within the latent space of BEV-VAE, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) generates BEV representations conditioned on 3D object layouts, enabling multi-view image synthesis with enhanced spatial consistency on nuScenes and achieving the first complete seven-view synthesis on AV2.
Finally, synthesized imagery significantly improves the perception performance of BEVFormer, highlighting the utility of scalable and generalizable scene synthesis for autonomous driving.

## Method
### Overall architecture of BEV-VAE with DiT for multi-view image generation.
![framework](./assets/framework.png)
In Stage 1, BEV-VAE learns to encode multi-view images into a spatially compact latent space in BEV and reconstruct them, ensuring spatial consistency. In Stage 2, DiT is trained with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) in this latent space to generate BEV representations from random noise, which are then decoded into multi-view images.

## Experiments

### Datasets
This study uses four multi-camera autonomous driving datasets that differ substantially in scale, camera configuration, annotated categories, and recording locations. Despite these differences, all datasets provide full 360° coverage of the surrounding scene.

We introduce a new hybrid autonomous driving dataset configuration, <b>PAS</b>, which combines nu<b>P</b>lan, <b>A</b>V2, and nu<b>S</b>cenes.

### Multi-view Image Reconstruction
BEV-VAE learns unified BEV representations by reconstructing multi-view images, integrating semantics from all camera views while modeling 3D spatial structure. Reconstruction metrics provide an indirect evaluation of the quality of the learned BEV representations. For reference, we compare with SD-VAE, a foundational model trained on LAION-5B, which encodes a single $256\times256$ image into a $32 \times32\times4$ latent. In contrast, BEV-VAE encodes multiple $256\times256$ views into a $32\times32\times16$ BEV latent, facing the more challenging task of modeling underlying 3D structure.

### Data Augmentation for Perception
BEV-VAE w/ DiT using the Historical Frame Replacement strategy (randomly replacing real frames with generated ones) improves BEVFormer’s perception by enabling the model to learn invariance of object locations relative to appearance.
